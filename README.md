# nlp-twitter-sentiment


  I have enjoyed learning more about NLP and how it can be used and
  productized in the real world. I found a toy dataset of tweets about
  natrual disasters that was labeled. This dataset lends itself well to
  sentiment analysis, but also text clustering and topic modeling (LDA).
  I have been able to also explore a few NLP packages such as NLTK,
  gensim, and Hugging Face.
  
  This repo is a work in progress and will continue to be updated. Eventually the models will be hosted in a container and will be publicly avalible through AWS Sagemaker.
